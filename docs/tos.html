    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <p class="last-updated"><strong>Last Updated:</strong> December 17, 2025</p>

    <h2>1. What This App Is</h2>
    <p>Breath Bro is a breathing and mindfulness app made to help you slow down, relax, and be more aware of your breath. It's here to support calm — not to diagnose, treat, or cure anything.</p>

    <h2>2. Not Medical Advice</h2>
    <p>Breath Bro is not medical or mental health advice. It's not a replacement for a doctor, therapist, or other professional.</p>
    <p>If you have a medical condition or concerns, talk to a qualified professional. If anything feels uncomfortable, overwhelming, or wrong while using the app, stop using it. Listen to your body. You're always in control.</p>

    <h2>3. Your Responsibility</h2>
    <p>By using the app, you agree to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Use it in a way that feels safe and reasonable for you</li>
        <li>Stop if it doesn't feel good</li>
        <li>Use it for personal, lawful purposes</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Using the App</h2>
    <p>The app is provided as-is. I do my best to make it stable, helpful, and calming, but:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>I can't promise it will always work perfectly</li>
        <li>I can't promise specific results</li>
        <li>Features may change over time</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Changes & Availability</h2>
    <p>The app may be updated, changed, or stopped at any time. New features may be added, and others may be removed.</p>

    <h2>6. Ownership</h2>
    <p>Everything in the app — sounds, text, visuals, and code — belongs to Breath Bro or is used with permission. Please don't copy or resell it without consent.</p>

    <h2>7. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The app uses a few third-party services (like crash reporting or quote APIs) to keep things running smoothly. I'm not responsible for how those services operate.</p>

    <h2>8. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>To the extent allowed by law, Breath Bro isn't responsible for damages or issues that come from using the app. You're choosing to use it at your own discretion.</p>

    <h2>9. If You Stop Using the App</h2>
    <p>You can uninstall the app at any time. That's all you need to do.</p>

    <h2>10. Contact</h2>
    <div class="contact-info">
        <p>Questions, concerns, or just want to reach out?</p>
        <p><strong>Email:</strong> hello@breathbro.app</p>
        <p><strong>Subject:</strong> "Breath Bro Terms"</p>
